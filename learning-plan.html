    <h2>My Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, one of my specific long term goals is to create a board game, that uses a phone application as part of 
      its game play.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      Reflecting on my previous strengths and limitations, I still feel alot of what I previouisly felt. 
      I think my biggest strength will be to learn fast. I think i am good at learning technical concepts reasonably 
      well. I think my limitation will be managing time outside of class hours to dedicate to coding. I think  I will 
      need to figure out a routine to do work outside of class.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      I think staying on top of material will be my main concern at this point. Same as my limitation, I think I will 
      very much need to make sure I do not slip up too much time early in the week/ early in bootcamp. I feel if I can 
      achieve this I should be fine.
    </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I would want to develop my communication skills in times of stress. I think that I want to improve my ability to 
      ask for help when I am stressed out. I think I am very aware of myself in these situation now, and have been 
      able to work on this during foundation. So I think as long as I keep myself upto date on workload and communicate 
      when I am struggling, I feel confident on my progress.
    </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
      I think my expectations from the team are what I have had during foundation. They will be present when I am stuck 
      or need help. I think outside of that we will be quite autonomous with our workload. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      I think the most important objective that I need to do is book time to workoutside of classtime, and commit to it. 
      I think I should also book time where I am not supposed to work, so that I also manage a balance without tipping 
      over to either side.

    <h2>My Learning Plan - Foundation</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to have a career that will give me oppertunities to work anywhere across
      the world.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>
      I feel a strength of mine when it comes to learning is that I am able to take on a lot of 
      content and sift through it and find information that is relevant to what is required of me to 
      know and not get overwhelmed by information that is above my knowledge, and stick to what I need 
      from resourses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggest limitation for me is staying focused, and getting work done. I find that my biggest 
      distraction can be my surroundings, and that I am not always in the most appropriate area to 
      work. I am slowly findings what kinds of environments work better for me as well as, when during 
      the day/week I am at my most effective.
    </p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      Being more myself around people. I tend to find that in a professional setting, I can tend to
      become the shy/quiet person, which is me not being myself. I find in casual settings I am a 
      different person. So I want to be able to find a balance of being me in a professional setting.
    </p>
    <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
    <p>
      I think that i work best when I have people around me working too, helps keep me stay on 
      task, so I think during bootcamp managing myself with be easier than foundation. How I intend 
      to manage myself in foundation is I have options of people working from home, I am going to go
      work out from there place to help keep me working. 
    </p>
    <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      I think that I am definitely someone who might have trouble speaking up when I am 
      struggling/ or falling behind. I intend to be completely open about how I am managing 
      with my facilitators and talk with them if I am falling behind earlier rather than later. 
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect the team to be present.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
      For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to 
      plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>In general, I do not have any regular appointments that need block-out times.</p>
