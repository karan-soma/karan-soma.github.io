      <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>My long term goal is to have a career that will give me oppertunities to work anywhere across
         the world.</p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p> I feel a strength of mine when it comes to learning is that I am able to take on a lot of 
        content and sift through it and find information that is relevant to what is required of me to 
        know and not get overwhelmed by information that is above my knowledge, and stick to what I need 
        from resourses.
      </p>
      <p>Biggest limitation for me is staying focused, and getting work done. I find that my biggest 
        distraction can be my surroundings, and that I am not always in the most appropriate area to 
        work. I am slowly findings what kinds of environments work better for me as well as, when during 
        the day/week I am at my most effective. </p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself 
          while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Being more myself around people. I tend to find that in a professional setting, I can tend to
           become the shy/quiet person, which is me not being myself. I find in casual settings I am a 
           different person. So I want to be able to find a balance of being me in a professional setting. </p>
          <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          </h3>
          <p>I think that i work best when I have people around me working too, helps keep me stay on 
            task, so I think during bootcamp managing myself with be easier than foundation. How I intend 
            to manage myself in foundation is I have options of people working from home, I am going to go
             work out from there place to help keep me working. 
          </p>
          <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </h3>
            <p> I think that I am definitely someone who might have trouble speaking up when I am 
              struggling/ or falling behind. I intend to be completely open about how I am managing 
              with my facilitators and talk with them if I am falling behind earlier rather than later. 
            </p>
            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I expect the team to be present. </p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
               For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to 
               plan these in.</h3>
               <p>In general, I do not have any regular appointments that need block-out times.</p>
