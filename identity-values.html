      <h2>My Identity Values</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the 
      values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p>
        Many years ago I found some money on the street, for content about $500 in a stack. There was no 
        way to identify whose the money it was. I basically had the decision to either keep the money or hand 
        it in to the police. The dilemma I basically had was this is a lot of money and it is not mine. 
        If I had lost that much I would be devastated, so I ended up returning it. If I am being completely honest, there was a lot of 
        temptation for me to keep it, like I said it is a lot of money. And being more honest if there was less 
        money there I would have been even more tempted to keep it. I do feel good about the decision I made, I know 
        it was the right decision, I am more proud of myself that I made that choice and not keep the money.
      </p>
      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a fairly traditional Indian family, while living in NZ. Growing up I was saw a lot of different
        cultures because a lot of my friends were not caucasian either, so I was exposed to different viewpoints. From 
        my research on myself and finding my values, one that stood out very clearly, was the idea of having good people
        around you and that your family are the people you are closest with. I think this part of myself comes from my
        Indian heritage where its very common to call anyone you meet a brother or sister, or an aunt or uncle. As I have 
        grown up I have kept this value closely and am so fortunate now to have so many people in my life I love. 
      </p>
      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p>
        I think a strength of mine is I am good at having perspective on an issue. I feel other people can sometimes
        tunnel vision on an issue and spiral into stress, when unnessesary. I think I am good at looking at an issue in
        a wider contexts and not get bogged down my little details. I think this will help me in my learning journey, because
        I think coding has so many rabbit holes you can fall down and get trapped. I think that my stregth will help me
        move through the content at a reasonable pace, while learning what I need to. 
      </p>
      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect 
        your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>I think sometimes maintaining focus and movitation is a limitation of mine. I think that this could risk me
         falling behind, and not be at the level I need to be either at the end of this course, or once I am out in the 
         workforce. I feel I am working well to overcome this by putting myself in an environment where I can stay focused, 
         taking breaks to keep my mind focused for longer. It has been difficult to begin with but it is slowly improving.
      </p>
      <p>Another limitation for me is sometimes at stressful times, I tend to become quiet and not communicate with 
        others when need be. I think when I am stressed I internalise it alot. What I am going to be aiming to do going forward, 
      is when I start to feel pressured, find someone to talk to ie. a friend, study buddy, or facilitator. I want to start early as 
    to  avoid a lot of stress being piled up.</p>
      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was 
        resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and 
        your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>When I was in university, I had a study group with people that used to stress out alot. One particular time, 
        the day before an exam we were studying and one person in particular was stressing out and had started to cry and shout. 
        I think as a group many people fell into the pit of stress and also started to lose focus on what was happening. 
        I suggested everyone leave the room for a little while, to cool off, and refocus. After about 15 minutes we came back 
        together to keep studying. We talked for abit about how we were feeling now, and it seemed in general everyone 
        had taken a step back and now had refocused. It was pretty shocking how effective that was. It felt like everyone 
        had worked eachother up and some space by ourselves destressed everyone. I think the strategy worked reasonably 
        effectively. In hindsight, I would probably to the same, but probably try getting space at good intervals rather 
        than waiting for the tension to build to a breaking point.
