      <h2>Javascript - DOM</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
      <p>Javascript (JS) is a programming language, like HTML and CSS. Where HTML provides content on the 
        page, and CSS is how the content is displayed, JS provides actions and interactions on the page. 
        Javascript allows for a user to interact with a dynamic webpage without having to refresh the page 
        everytime. This can be used for things like animations on a website, having a response, when you 
      submit a form, or press a button.</p>
      <h3>What are Control Flows and Loops?</h3>
      <p>Control Flow is basically the order in which a JS file is run. The standard means of operation 
        for the control flow is that it will run from top to bottom, unless some form of coding is used to 
        change the flow. Loops, are such things that affect control flow. Loops that can be used 
        to repeat code a number of times based on the conditions placed on it. Once the condition is met to stop 
        the loop, then the control flow reverts back to reading top to bottom. Another example is IF/ELSE 
      statements. These are sections of code that have conditions. If the condition is met certain code is run 
    and if the condition is not met, other code is used instead. In this instance the control flow might skip over 
  pieces of programming. </p>
        <p>An anology to view control flow and loops is say the task of doing laundry. There is a step by 
          step way to do laundry that a person would do top to bottom: wash clothes in washing machine, 
          dry them, fold them, put them away. Thats the standard flow of laundry. Now we know how to fold laundry 
          but we do not just fold a piece of clothing, no, we fold them all. This is an equivalent to a loop. You will 
          fold a piece of clothing over and over again. The condition to stop folding is when all the clothes are folded. Thats looping. 
          And lastly If/Else statements. So say when we are drying the clothes its raining, we would have to dry 
          the clothes in the dryer. If it was sunny, then we would hang the clothes outside. That is essentially an 
          if/else statement. Depending on the circumstance, we dry clothes in one particular way, and ignore the second 
          way altogether. 
      </p>
      <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
      <p>The DOM (Document Object Model), is the model of how a webpage is structured. The structure looks like 
        a tree branch diagram, where the intial root is the document, and from there branches off all the 
        componenets of the page. Below is an example: </p>
        <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/domexample.png" alt="DOM diagram" 
        style="width: 450px;height:300px;">
      <p>From the image you can see that the branches are elements we are already familier with: head, 
        body, h2 etc. Each branch that splits off eventually will end at one element only. Given each element 
      has its own unique branch path from the main root (document) to it, means that we have a way to directly call 
    upon that element. And that is basically the main benefits of the DOM, it provides a structure that 
  allows us to interact with groups or individual elements.</p>
      <h3>Arrays vs. Objects</h3>
      <p>Objects are like containers that you can use to store other bits of information in. The 
        information stored in an object is unordered, and is stored in a key:value pair format. What 
        that means is that for any piece of information in an  object, there is a key which  
        is like a descriptor for the information, and the value is the information. Objects look like this: 
      </p>
      <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/objectex1.png" alt="Object example" 
      >
      <p>The object above contains information about a single individual. The object is called 'person' 
        and has information about them. Note the key shows what the information is, and the value is the 
        information. Using this key/value pair, we can then access information in the object. The notation 
        used is a '.' between the object name and key name:
      </p>
      <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/objectex2.png" alt="Accessing Objects example" 
      >
      <p>This code is accessing the value that is associated with the key 'name' in the object 'person'</p>
      <p>Arrays are similar to objects in that they are also like containers that include information 
        inside of them. However, unlike an object the items in the array are ordered (note: the order in 
        arrays start at 0, not 1). And do not come in a key/value pair. Arrays look like this: 
      </p>
      <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/arrayex1.png" alt="Array example" 
      >
      <p>That array contains a list of countries, and it called 'countries'. To access a piece of information 
        in an array'[]' is used: </p>
      <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/arrayex2.png" alt="Accessing array example" 
      >
      <p>This code is accessing the [1] ordered object in the array countries. It will return 'Australia' 
        as remember that numbering in arrays starts at 0, 'New Zealand is at the 0 spot, and 'Australia' 
        is at the 1 spot.
      </p>
      <h3>What are Functions?</h3>
      <p>Function are code that are used to perform tasks. Rather than coding a task multiple times in each 
        instance you want to use that code, you can make a function that performs a particular task once. Then 
        whenever you want to do that task again, you can just call upon the function,
         rather than coding the task again. Example of a function: 
      </p>
      <img class="homephotos" src="myblogphotos/functionex1.png" alt="Defining a function">
      <p>You can add variables into the function too, that can be specified when you call the function. 
        Note that a function does nothing on its own. You need to call upon the function for it to 
        run. The function above takes the x value and y value and sums them together, and 
        console logs the answer, when called. Below the function is run, and variables are added. So 
        I have called upon the adding function. I have told it x = 2, y = 3. So, it should console log '5'. 
      </p>
