    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>A time I was stuck...</h3>
    <p>
      A problem I got stuck on was during the Manipulating Objects kata. The problem was adding an empty 
      object within an object, and I got really stuck on how to code this. I felt like my code was correct, 
      I was asking it the right thing. I played around with the issue for a while, then decided to take a 
      break. During the break, I decided to try the Rubber Ducky method. I had researched it earlier in the 
      week, and thought lets just give it a go. So I did, I tried to explain to a bottle, what I was trying 
      to achieve. And it was something in the way I worded it, that made a spark in my brain go "WAIT!". 
      The code I had written did not exactly match what I was describing, I was missing a small piece 
      of what it was asking me to. So I fixed that issue I felt was wrong, tried what I think actually made 
      sense, and shockingly it worked! I felt abit stressed throughout this process. It was very early into 
      the kata exercises, and I felt if I get this stuck now, the later katas are going to be impossible. 
      But after I had solved it, I felt very confident in proceding, having utilised new skills, both 
      coding and problem solving. I feel I learned the importance of trying new techniques and methods. I 
      feel sometimes I am prone to only try methods that I am used to. But having success with something 
      like the rubber ducky method, I feel confident trying something new. 
    </p>
    <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem...</h3>
    <p>
      A problem I felt I solved elegantly was the deBee problem in this weeks Built-In Functions kata. 
      The problem was creating a function that would remove the word 'buzz' any string passed through it. 
      I worked my way through the problem using a combination of: the rubber ducky method, where I verbalised 
      step by step what I wanted the function to do, googling gaps of information I had, such as the 
      in-built methods I was not familier with. This along with reflecting on work I had in previous katas 
      I worked out the solution. I honestly felt really comfortable, and confident working through the problem 
      I felt I had a good grasp of the issue, and I utilised different problem solving techniques at 
      different obstacles to get through the problem with not a lot of resistance. I learned that I am 
      capable of interpolating things I had learnt previously, and applying that knowledge to other problems 
      really well. I learnt to use techniques such as the rubber ducky method in a way that worked well for 
      me, where I would sometimes concurrently describe my issue verbally, and then follow my code to see 
      where my describtion did not line up to my code. 
    </p>
    <h3>Reflecting on Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
    <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
    <p>
      I only starting using Pseudocode this week, but had seen the Javascript Cafe video, where
      it was used alot so I got to appreciate the value of doing it. I tried a little bit this week,
      to do so, and I think that it does help. Particularly helps to keep the code you write focused 
      and makes the objectives clear by writing out small chucks of the process at a time. 
    </p>
    <h4>Trying Something</h4>
    <p>
      This is probably the technique that I have been using mostly up until now. My process was trying 
      something that somewhat made sense to me, running it, then deconstructing what I had and trying to locate
      there the issue might be coming from. The problem I have doing this sometimes is that it can lead 
      me down a very non relavent path of working and may take me some time to realise that I am not on 
      track. 
    </p>
    <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
    <p>
      I researched this method a little bit this week, because it had the most interesting name. I ended 
      up using this method, weirdly in the shower because I thought why not?, when I was stuck on a 
      kata, and it actually worked. I came up with a solution to my problem, tested it out and, I solved 
      the issue, it was kind of wild.
    </p>
    <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
    <p>
      This is something that I am still trying to get used to. There have been a few instances where, I 
      have successfully done this, but I am still not too confident with using this as a tool.
    </p>
    <h4>Console.logging</h4>
    <p>
      This I have been doing little bits of since the start of this course, and I find it does help 
      track where your code is working and where its not. So I do like this technique, and I feel I am 
      slowly getting better at using it. 
    </p>
    <h4>Googling</h4>
    <p>
      This technique has been incredibly useful so far in DevAcademy. There are so many little things 
      that I either need a recap on, or just need to quickly figure out. Googling has been so efficient 
      in closing those little gaps of information I need to keep moving forward with my work. I am very 
      confident with this. I am still trying to become better at identifying which sites provide the best 
      coding information though.  
    </p>
    <h4>Asking peers for help</h4>
    <p>
      Historically, I am someone that has been quite bad at asking others for help, I usually go to 
      google first. But I think so far in DevAcademy I have done a good job at asking for help, particularly 
      my peers. Discord makes it very easy to ask for help, and I feel comfortable doing so if need be. 
    </p>
    <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
    <p>
      So far I fortunately have not really come across an issue that I have needed a coaches help directly. I 
      use discord to ask for help from peers and coaches, and usually both are helpful with any issues 
      I am having. But I feel comfortable if something was really wrong and I needed help I would go to 
      a coach. 
    </p>
    <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
    <p>
      I think this something that I need to start doing more often, and sooner after I solve problems. 
      I think when I set stuck on an issue thats similar to a previous issue I will reflect then on how 
      I solved the previous problem, but I wont reflect prior to that. And I feel by that time, the 
      reflecting is not as effective that it would have been if I had it a lot closer to the time, I 
      had solved the issue.
